THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT TAKING DATA FROM A CSV FILE AND THEN BY
COMPARING WITH GIVEN THRESHOLD, REPRESENTING IT WITH A COLOUR
VALUE. IN THE GIVEN EXAMPLE, WE HAVE DISPLAYED QUITE A SMALL
DATA SET AS TO SHOW THE OUTPUT BUT WE CAN USE THE SAME PROGRAM
TO EFFICIENTLY HANDLE VERY LARGE DATA SET WITH HELP OF MPI.
